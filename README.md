# reFresh

**Don't let wasted groceries weigh you down; reFresh your life with a weekly, easy-to-follow and waste-less grocery list!**

Refresh is a web application designed to generate recipes based on your inputted ingredients, while generating new recipes based on your leftover ingredients from previously generated recipes thus reducing food waste!

It interfaces with the Walmart website to pull product information too.
